# Random_Walk
Simulation of 2D and 3D random walk and application to stock market prediction

Jupyter Python notebooks for 
  (1) Simulation of random walk without any drift and variability
  (2) analysis of data generated from simulation to establish various empirical relations between average distance travelled with the number of steps
  (3) recurrence of random walk
  (4) Studies ramdon walk with drift
  (5) application of random walk as a model for stock price analysis
